      "I’m sorry you’re having a tough time with those lost templates. While I can’t recover the actual files for you, I can walk you through a systematic approach to maximize the chances of getting them back. Below is a step‑by‑step playbook that covers common sources of data loss and the recovery options most likely to be successful:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Identify the Last Known Location\n| What to Check | Why It Matters | Quick Tip |\n|---------------|----------------|-----------|\n| **Local Disk** (C:\\, D:\\, etc.) | Most files start there before cloud sync | Use Windows Search (`Ctrl + F`) for file extensions (`*.docx`, `*.pdf`, `*.txt`, etc.) |\n| **External Drives** | Sometimes you copy files to USB or external HDDs | Plug them in, then run the search. |\n| **Email Attachments** | You may have emailed the template to yourself | Search your inbox for file names or attachments. |\n| **Cloud Drives** (OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud) | Automatic sync may have stored a copy | Open the web interface, look in “Trash” or “Bin.” |\n| **Archive/Backup** (Zip, TAR, etc.) | You may have compressed the folder before deleting | Search for any archives that contain the folder name. |\n| **Version Control** (Git, SVN) | If you used a repo, the commit history holds every change | Run `git log --all -- path/to/template` or equivalent. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Check “Recycle Bin” / “Trash”\n\n1. **Windows** – Double‑click the Recycle Bin, sort by “Date Deleted.”  \n2. **macOS** – Click the Trash icon in the dock, then “Empty Trash.”  \n3. **Linux** – Many DEs keep a “Trash” folder; inspect `~/.local/share/Trash/files`.\n\n*If you find the template, simply restore it. If the file has already been permanently deleted, move on to the next step.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Search for Recent Backups\n\n| Backup System | How to Restore |\n|---------------|----------------|\n| **Windows File History** | `Settings → Update & Security → Backup → More options → Restore files from a current backup` |\n| **macOS Time Machine** | Connect the backup drive, click the Time Machine icon → “Enter Time Machine” |\n| **Cloud Backup Services** (Backblaze, Carbonite, etc.) | Log into the web console, locate the file in the file browser, then restore or download. |\n| **Enterprise Backup** (Veeam, Commvault, etc.) | Contact your IT team or the backup admin; they can run a “restore from snapshot” for that path. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Use File‑Recovery Software (if the file was permanently deleted)\n\n| Tool | Platform | Key Features |\n|------|----------|--------------|\n| **Recuva** | Windows | Free version, deep scan, preview recovered files |\n| **PhotoRec / TestDisk** | Windows/macOS/Linux | Open‑source, works on many filesystems |\n| **Disk Drill** | Windows/macOS | User‑friendly, supports NTFS, FAT, ext4, HFS+ |\n| **EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard** | Windows/macOS | GUI, selective recovery |\n| **Stellar Data Recovery** | Windows/macOS | Advanced filtering |\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. **Stop using the drive** – write‑operations can overwrite the deleted data.  \n2. **Run the recovery tool in “deep scan” mode** – it will search for file headers rather than relying on the file system.  \n3. **Filter by file type** – e.g., `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.xlsx`.  \n4. **Preview and recover** – Save to a *different* drive to avoid overwriting.  \n\n> ⚠️ *Note*: The success rate decreases the longer you wait and the more you write to the drive.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Look for Hidden or Temporary Copies\n\n* **Temporary Files** – Some editors (Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice) store autosave copies in `C:\\Users\\<YourUser>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\UnsavedFiles` or similar.  \n* **Drafts** – Email clients often keep a draft folder; check for any unsent emails with attachments.  \n* **Shared Workspaces** – If you used a project management tool (Asana, Trello, Monday.com), attachments might be stored there.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Check Your Version Control History (If You Had One)\n\nIf you ever committed the template to a repo (Git, Mercurial, SVN, etc.):\n\n```bash\n# In the repo root\ngit log --all --pretty=format:\"%h %an %ad %s\" --date=short\ngit show <commit-hash> -- path/to/template\n```\n\nIf the file existed in a previous commit, you can cherry‑pick or checkout that version:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout <commit-hash> -- path/to/template\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Contact IT or a Data‑Recovery Specialist\n\nIf you’re in a corporate environment, the IT department may have:\n\n* **Enterprise backups** (daily, weekly).  \n* **Snapshot or VM backups** that contain the state of the machine at a point in time.  \n* **Legal hold** or **e‑Discovery** tools that preserve deleted files.\n\nIf it’s a personal machine and you’re still stuck, a professional data‑recovery service can often retrieve files that software can’t see—though it can be pricey, especially for larger drives or complex failures.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Prevent Future Losses\n\n| Prevention | Tool / Practice |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| **Version Control** | Git (local repo) or GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket for cloud backup |\n| **Automated Backups** | Windows File History, macOS Time Machine, cloud sync services |\n| **Redundant Copies** | Store a copy on an external drive and in a cloud bucket |\n| **Naming Convention** | Include dates or version numbers in filenames |\n| **Regular Export** | Periodically export templates to a separate “Archive” folder |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n1. ✅ Search local, external, cloud, and email for the file.  \n2. ✅ Check Recycle Bin/Trash.  \n3. ✅ Look for backups (File History, Time Machine, enterprise).  \n4. ✅ Run a deep‑scan recovery tool on the drive where the file was stored.  \n5. ✅ Search for hidden temp or autosave copies.  \n6. ✅ Review your version‑control history.  \n7. ✅ Reach out to IT or a data‑recovery specialist if needed.  \n\nIf you let me know which operating system, cloud services, or backup solutions you’re using, I can give you even more tailored steps. Good luck—hopefully one of these approaches brings your templates back!",
      "Below are two **illustrative, industry‑common** examples that capture the “feel” and key elements you’ll usually see in a commercial NDA.  \n*(These are not a substitute for legal counsel, but they should jog your memory of the typical wording and structure.)*\n\n---\n\n## 1. Definition of Confidential Information\n\n> **“Confidential Information”** means any data, know‑how, documentation, or information – whether oral, written, electronic, or in any other form – that is disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party and that (i) is marked or identified as confidential at the time of disclosure, or (ii) the Receiving Party would reasonably understand to be confidential given the nature of the information or the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, business plans, financial projections, technical specifications, source code, product designs, customer lists, pricing information, marketing strategies, and any other information that the Disclosing Party considers proprietary or that a reasonable person would recognize as sensitive.  \n>   \n> The definition does **not** apply to information that:  \n> (a) was already lawfully in the Receiving Party’s possession without any obligation of confidentiality;  \n> (b) becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party;  \n> (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Confidential Information; or  \n> (d) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, or a valid court or governmental order, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prompt written notice and cooperates in any protective‑order proceedings.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Term and Termination\n\n> **Term.** This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of **two (2) years** (the “Term”), unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Section.  \n>   \n> **Termination for Convenience.** Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon **thirty (30) days’ written notice** to the other Party.  \n>   \n> **Termination for Cause.** Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other Party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within **fifteen (15) days** after receipt of notice of the breach.  \n>   \n> **Effect of Termination.** Upon termination, the Receiving Party shall:  \n> (a) promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information (and all copies thereof) in its possession, and certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that it has complied with this obligation;  \n> (b) continue to be bound by the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement for **five (5) years** after termination; and  \n> (c) pay any accrued fees or expenses owed to the Disclosing Party that were incurred prior to termination.  \n>   \n> **Survival.** Sections **[X] – Confidentiality Obligations**, **[Y] – Remedies**, and **[Z] – Miscellaneous** shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n---\n\n### Why These Clauses Matter\n\n| Clause | Purpose | Typical Language to Look For |\n|--------|---------|------------------------------|\n| **Definition of Confidential Information** | Sets the scope of what must be protected. | “Any data, know‑how, documentation … that is marked or identified as confidential …” |\n| **Term and Termination** | Determines the duration and how the agreement can be ended. | “commences on the Effective Date … terminates … upon thirty (30) days’ written notice” |\n| **Survival** | Ensures that confidentiality obligations persist even after the contract ends. | “survive termination … for five (5) years” |\n\n---\n\n## Quick Tips for Remembering or Re‑creating Your Own NDA\n\n1. **Use a “template‑first” approach:** Start with a generic NDA template, then insert the parties, dates, and any specific exclusions or carve‑outs that were unique to your situation.\n2. **Highlight key phrases:** In your notes, underline or bold the words “Confidential Information,” “Term,” “Termination,” and “Survival” – these anchor points help you reconstruct the clause structure.\n3. **Keep a “Clause Dictionary”:** Maintain a small spreadsheet or document that lists common NDA clauses with a one‑sentence summary and a sample phrase. This turns recall into a lookup exercise.\n4. **Version‑control your NDA drafts:** Even if you don’t use a public Git repo, a local Git folder on your machine can preserve every revision, making it trivial to retrieve a previous version if you lose the latest copy.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The two samples above are the most frequently seen phrasings in commercial NDAs. If you can remember the overall flow (definition → obligations → term/termination → survival), you’ll usually be able to reconstruct the missing template with only minor edits. Good luck!",
      "Below are **ready‑to‑copy boilerplate snippets** that you can drop straight into a new NDA (or adapt to your own template).  \nI’ve split them into the two areas you asked for and included a few common variants that capture the “joint‑development” or “acquisition‑evaluation” flavor, as well as the “cloud/backup” nuance for the return clause.  \n\n> ⚠️ *These are illustrative examples only.  Adapt them to your jurisdiction and have an attorney review them before use.*\n\n---\n\n## 1. Purpose of Disclosure\n\n| Scenario | Boilerplate Text | Notes |\n|----------|-----------------|-------|\n| **Joint Development of New Software** | **Purpose.** The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information solely to develop, test, and refine software jointly with the Disclosing Party (“Project”) and to evaluate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the Project. The Receiving Party shall use the Confidential Information only as necessary to perform its obligations under the Project and shall not disclose it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. | *“Project” is a placeholder you can replace with the actual project name.  The key phrase is “solely to develop, test, and refine software jointly with the Disclosing Party.” |\n| **Evaluation of a Potential Acquisition** | **Purpose.** The Receiving Party may use the Confidential Information only to evaluate a potential acquisition or business combination involving the Disclosing Party (“Evaluation”). The Receiving Party shall not use the Confidential Information for any other purpose, including for its own product development or marketing. | *This wording makes it clear that the only permissible use is the acquisition evaluation.* |\n| **Combined Development & Acquisition Evaluation** | **Purpose.** The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information for the purpose of (i) collaborating on the design, development, and testing of new software (the “Development”), and (ii) evaluating a potential acquisition of the Disclosing Party (the “Acquisition Evaluation”). The Receiving Party shall limit the use of the Confidential Information to the Development and Acquisition Evaluation activities and shall not disclose it to any third party without prior written consent. | *Use this if you need to cover both scenarios in a single NDA.* |\n| **General “Other Purpose” Clause** | **Purpose.** The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only for the purpose of (a) evaluating a potential business relationship between the Parties, (b) providing technical support to the Disclosing Party, or (c) complying with a legal or regulatory obligation. No other use of the Confidential Information is permitted. | *Good for a “one‑size‑fits‑all” clause that you can customize.* |\n\n**Common Phrases to Keep in Mind**\n\n- “solely to …”  \n- “only as necessary to perform its obligations”  \n- “shall not disclose … without prior written consent”  \n- “evaluate … business relationship”  \n- “compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation”\n\n---\n\n## 2. Return of Confidential Information (with Cloud & Backup Details)\n\n| Variant | Boilerplate Text | Notes |\n|---------|------------------|-------|\n| **Basic Return** | **Return/Destruction.** Upon termination of this Agreement or upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall: (i) return all tangible copies of Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party; and (ii) destroy all non‑tangible copies, including electronic copies, and provide the Disclosing Party with a written certification of such destruction. | *This is the classic “return or destroy” language.* |\n| **Cloud‑Based Storage** | **Return/Destruction.** Upon termination of this Agreement or upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall: (i) delete all Confidential Information stored in the Receiving Party’s cloud services (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, Dropbox, Box, OneDrive, etc.) and any associated metadata; (ii) delete or overwrite any copies of Confidential Information in shared or collaborative cloud workspaces; and (iii) provide the Disclosing Party with written certification that the deletion has been performed and that no recoverable copies remain. | *Explicitly lists common cloud providers and clarifies “overwrite.”* |\n| **Embedded in Backups** | **Return/Destruction.** The Receiving Party shall ensure that any backups—whether automated, manual, or archival—containing Confidential Information are purged or overwritten. The Receiving Party shall: (i) delete the relevant backup files from all backup storage systems; (ii) overwrite any residual data on backup media; and (iii) provide the Disclosing Party with a written statement confirming the deletion and overwrite actions. | *Addresses the “embedded in archived backups” scenario.* |\n| **Combined Cloud & Backup** | **Return/Destruction.** Upon termination of this Agreement or upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall: <br>• Delete all Confidential Information from all cloud services (including, but not limited to, Amazon S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, Dropbox, Box, OneDrive, etc.) and any associated metadata; <br>• Purge all backups (automated or manual) that contain any Confidential Information, overwriting residual data as needed; <br>• Remove all copies from local storage, external drives, and any other media; <br>• Provide the Disclosing Party with a written certification that all actions above have been completed and that no recoverable copies of Confidential Information remain. | *Use this when you want a single clause that covers everything.* |\n| **“Do Not Retain” Variation** | **No Retention.** The Receiving Party shall not retain any Confidential Information in any form after termination of this Agreement, except that the Receiving Party may retain a single, non‑disclosable backup copy for the purpose of internal audit compliance, which shall be stored on encrypted media and destroyed within 90 days of termination. | *Useful if you need a short‑term audit trail.* |\n\n**Key Phrases to Note**\n\n- “delete all … cloud services”  \n- “overwrite any residual data”  \n- “purge all backups”  \n- “provide written certification”  \n- “no recoverable copies remain”  \n- “non‑disclosable backup copy”  \n\n---\n\n## Quick “Memory‑Aid” Checklist\n\n| Item | Where to Look | Quick Phrase |\n|------|---------------|--------------|\n| **Purpose** | “Purpose. The Receiving Party may disclose … solely to …” | “solely to develop …” or “only to evaluate …” |\n| **Cloud Storage** | “delete all Confidential Information stored in the Receiving Party’s cloud services” | “Amazon S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage…” |\n| **Backups** | “purge all backups that contain any Confidential Information” | “overwrite residual data on backup media” |\n| **Certification** | “provide the Disclosing Party with written certification” | “no recoverable copies remain” |\n\n---\n\n### How to Use These Snippets\n\n1. **Copy & Paste** – Insert the appropriate clause into your template.  \n2. **Replace Placeholders** – Swap in your project name, dates, jurisdictional references, and any specific cloud provider names that are relevant to your organization.  \n3. **Audit** – Run a quick search for the exact phrase “purge all backups that contain any Confidential Information” in your document to confirm you didn’t miss a clause.  \n4. **Version‑Control** – Save the revised NDA in a versioned folder (e.g., Git, OneDrive “Templates” folder) so you can always pull it back later.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nIf you’re still trying to recover the exact wording of your lost NDA, the best trick is to search for **unique phrases** you remember—like “purge all backups” or “jointly developing software”—across your entire email history, cloud drives, and local machine. Even a single keyword can pull up the exact document or a previous draft in a search index.\n\nHappy drafting! If you need help tailoring the clauses further (e.g., for a specific jurisdiction or a very particular cloud setup), just let me know.",
      "Below are **ready‑to‑paste, “gold‑standard” excerpts** that go beyond the usual boilerplate.  \nThey are written in a style that a mature legal team in the software/technology space would adopt—complete with:\n\n* Proprietary internal references (e.g., “Clause ID 12.3.1 – Internal Risk Mitigation”)  \n* Specialized IP‑in‑open‑source carve‑outs  \n* Hard‑line personal‑data‑breach limits for a multi‑jurisdictional audience  \n* A bespoke dispute‑resolution ladder (mediation → binding arbitration in a neutral forum) that is often used to “circumvent” jurisdictional headaches  \n\n> **⚠️  These are illustrative examples.  They are NOT a substitute for legal counsel.  Adapt them to your local laws, have a qualified attorney review them, and replace the placeholders (e.g., “[Company]”, “[Jurisdiction]”) with the appropriate details.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Indemnification – IP & Open‑Source\n\n> **12.1 Indemnification – IP Infringement & Open‑Source**  \n> \n> 12.1.1 The **Receiving Party** shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the **Disclosing Party** (and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents) from any claim, suit, action, or proceeding (“Claim”) alleging infringement of any third‑party intellectual‑property right arising from the use, modification, or distribution of the Receiving Party’s deliverables, **provided that** the Claim is linked to the incorporation of any third‑party open‑source component that the Receiving Party failed to license or otherwise comply with.  \n> \n> 12.1.2 The Receiving Party’s indemnification obligation **shall not** apply if the Claim results from:  \n>  (a) the Disclosing Party’s intentional or negligent use of the Deliverables;  \n>  (b) the Disclosing Party’s use of the Deliverables in a manner outside the scope of the Agreement; or  \n>  (c) the Disclosing Party’s failure to comply with the terms of any open‑source license that the Deliverables are subject to.  \n> \n> 12.1.3 The Receiving Party shall (i) promptly notify the Disclosing Party in writing of any such Claim; (ii) provide the Disclosing Party with sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim, including the right to retain counsel of its choice, provided that counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Disclosing Party; and (iii) cooperate fully in the defense.  \n> \n> 12.1.4 The Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with a written update no later than **15 business days** after receipt of notice of a Claim, and shall furnish such documentation as the Disclosing Party deems necessary to evaluate the Claim and the potential indemnity.  \n\n> **Internal Reference:** *Clause ID 12.1.1 – “IP‑Infringement Shield” – aligns with the internal “IP Compliance Handbook V3.2, Section 4.1.”*  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Limitation of Liability – Cap, Exclusions, and Data‑Security\n\n> **13.1 Limitation of Liability**  \n> \n> 13.1.1 Except for liability arising from (i) gross negligence or willful misconduct, (ii) breach of confidentiality, or (iii) violation of applicable data‑protection law, **neither party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages** (including, but not limited to, loss of profits, loss of business, or reputational harm), regardless of the cause of action or theory of liability.  \n> \n> 13.1.2 **Cap on Damages.**  \n>  (a) The aggregate liability of each party under this Agreement shall not exceed the greater of:  \n>   (i) **$1,000,000** (U.S. dollars) in total; or  \n>   (ii) **Three (3) times** the total fees paid by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party under this Agreement.  \n>  (b) The cap in 13.1.2(a)(i) applies **exclusively** to claims arising from data‑breach incidents (see 13.2).  \n> \n> 13.1.3 **Data‑Security‑Specific Cap.**  \n>  The Receiving Party’s liability for any loss, damage, or claim arising from a personal data breach (including but not limited to GDPR Article 32 violations, CCPA “data breach” notices, or any other applicable privacy statute) shall be limited to **$5,000,000** or the amount of the breach‑related damages actually incurred by the Disclosing Party, whichever is lower.  \n> \n> 13.1.4 **No “Cumulative” Liability.**  The limitation in 13.1.1 and 13.1.2 shall not apply to the cumulative total of all claims that are a result of the same event or series of events, nor to any claim that is a direct or indirect result of a breach of this Agreement’s confidentiality obligations.  \n> \n> 13.1.5 **Severability.**  If any provision of this Section is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.  \n\n> **Internal Reference:** *Clause ID 13.1.2(b) – “Liability Cap – 3× Fees” – per Risk Register Entry RR‑2024‑07.*  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Data‑Security & Personal‑Data Breach\n\n> **14. Data‑Security & Personal‑Data Breach**  \n> \n> 14.1 **Security Standards.**  The Receiving Party shall implement and maintain security controls that meet or exceed the “Common Criteria for Information Security” (ISO/IEC 27001:2022) and shall conduct a bi‑annual penetration test (or more frequent if required by the nature of the data).  \n> \n> 14.2 **Notification.**  The Receiving Party shall (i) notify the Disclosing Party **within 72 hours** of becoming aware of a personal‑data breach; (ii) provide a concise description of the breach, the data affected, and the remedial steps taken; and (iii) cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party’s compliance and regulatory notification obligations.  \n> \n> 14.3 **Indemnity for Breach.**  The Receiving Party shall indemnify the Disclosing Party for all claims, losses, or damages directly attributable to a personal‑data breach **only** if the breach is caused by:  \n>  (a) a failure to implement the security controls required by 14.1; or  \n>  (b) the Receiving Party’s negligence or willful misconduct in the handling, storage, or transfer of personal data.  \n> \n> 14.4 **Exclusion.**  The Receiving Party’s indemnity shall **not** cover:  \n>  (i) claims arising from the Disclosing Party’s own negligence; or  \n>  (ii) claims resulting from the use of personal data in a manner inconsistent with the purpose outlined in Section 12.1.1.  \n> \n> 14.5 **Data‑Retention & Deletion.**  Upon termination of this Agreement or upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall delete or securely destroy all personal data in its possession, including any backups, and certify in writing that the data has been irrecoverably removed.  \n\n> **Internal Reference:** *Clause ID 14.3 – “Data‑Breach Indemnity” – referenced in the “Data Protection Policy – 2025‑01.”*  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Dispute Resolution – Multi‑Jurisdictional\n\n> **15. Dispute Resolution**  \n> \n> 15.1 **Initial Negotiation.**  Any dispute, claim, or disagreement arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall first be addressed in good faith by the parties in a confidential mediation session conducted in **English** and held in **New York, NY** (or another mutually agreed neutral venue). The parties shall share mediation costs equally.  \n> \n> 15.2 **Arbitration.**  If the dispute remains unresolved after mediation, the parties agree to submit the dispute to **binding arbitration** under the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Rules for Arbitration.  \n> \n> 15.3 **Arbitration Seat & Venue.**  The seat of arbitration shall be **Singapore**; the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in **English**. The parties shall each appoint one arbitrator and the arbitrators shall jointly appoint a third, non‑party arbitrator to serve as the sole arbitrator for the case.  \n> \n> 15.4 **Arbitration Award.**  The arbitral award shall be final, binding, and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.  \n> \n> 15.5 **Choice of Law.**  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of Delaware**, without regard to conflict‑of‑law principles, **except** for matters concerning data protection, which shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the personal data was processed (e.g., GDPR for EU residents).  \n> \n> 15.6 **Confidentiality of Proceedings.**  The parties agree to keep all arbitration proceedings and findings confidential, except as required by law or a court order.  \n\n> **Internal Reference:** *Clause ID 15.2 – “ICC Arbitration – Singapore” – per the company’s “Global Dispute Policy – v2.0.”*  \n\n---\n\n## 5. “Open‑Source License Compliance” Addendum (Optional)\n\n> **Addendum A – Open‑Source License Compliance**  \n> \n> 1. **Compliance Requirement.**  The Receiving Party shall maintain a current inventory of all open‑source components used in the Deliverables and shall ensure compliance with each component’s license.  \n> \n> 2. **License Documentation.**  The Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with the license text and any required attribution statements for each open‑source component upon request.  \n> \n> 3. **License Change Notification.**  The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party **within 10 business days** of any change in the license of a component that affects the Deliverables.  \n> \n> 4. **Indemnification for License Breach.**  The indemnification provisions in Section 12.1 shall cover claims arising from open‑source license violations.  \n\n> **Internal Reference:** *Clause ID Addendum‑A.1 – “Open‑Source Compliance” – aligns with the Open‑Source Governance Matrix (OGM‑2024‑Q4).*  \n\n---\n\n### How to Use These Clauses\n\n1. **Insert** the clause numbers that fit your existing template (e.g., “12.1”, “13.1”, etc.).  \n2. **Replace placeholders** with your company names, jurisdiction, fee caps, etc.  \n3. **Cross‑reference** any internal policy documents (e.g., “IP Compliance Handbook”, “Risk Register”) that your team already uses.  \n4. **Add the Open‑Source Addendum** if your projects routinely incorporate third‑party code.  \n5. **Version‑control** the updated NDA in your internal repo so you can always rollback.  \n\n---\n\n### Quick Takeaway\n\n* **Indemnification** → Guard against IP & open‑source breaches with clear carve‑outs.  \n* **Limitation** → Cap liability, exclude consequential damages, and set a hard ceiling for data‑breach scenarios.  \n* **Data‑Security** → Require ISO‑27001‑level controls, 72‑hour breach notification, and indemnify only for negligent causes.  \n* **Dispute** → Mediation → ICC arbitration in Singapore, governed by Delaware law, with a clear seat/venue and confidentiality.  \n* **Open‑Source** → Add a dedicated addendum that keeps the parties compliant and indemnified.  \n\nWith these snippets you should be able to reconstruct a “gold‑standard” NDA that matches the high‑risk, multi‑jurisdictional environment your team was used to.

      "Below is a **menu of “internal‑tracking” artifacts** that many large, mature legal departments embed in their contract templates.  \nThese artifacts are *not* part of the substantive legal language—they are **metadata, markers, and workflow tags** that allow the legal team to:\n\n1.  **Track lineage** (who created/modified what and when).  \n2.  **Classify risk** (so the right controls and approvals are applied).  \n3.  **Audit compliance** (who signed off, what review cycle was followed).  \n4.  **Integrate with document‑management / e‑signature platforms** (so the document can be routed automatically).  \n5.  **Version‑control** (prevent “shadow” versions from circulating).  \n\nWhen those elements are missing, the document looks like a generic, “public‑domain” template – a red flag for an incomplete or externally sourced file.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Document‑ID / Lifecycle Marker\n\n| Element | Typical Format | Why It Matters |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Document Control ID** | `DOC-<ClientCode>-<DocType>-<Year><Month><Day>.<Sequence>`  <br>Example: `DOC-ABC-nda-20240512-001` | Unique key that can be indexed in the DMS; prevents duplicate uploads. |\n| **Workflow‑Batch ID** | `WB-<WorkflowName>-<BatchDate>-<BatchNumber>`  <br>Example: `WB-ContractReview-2024-04-25-05` | Shows the batch the doc was pulled from for a particular review cycle. |\n| **Audit Trail Tag** | `AT-<DocID>-<Timestamp>-<UserID>`  <br>Example: `AT-DOC-ABC-nda-20240512-001-2024-04-25T14:32:00Z-U12345` | Captures who last saved the file and when (used by audit logs). |\n| **Retention Tag** | `RT-<RetentionPolicy>-<ExpiryDate>`  <br>Example: `RT-5Yr-2030-12-31` | Links the document to an internal retention schedule. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Version & Revision Metadata\n\n| Element | Typical Format | Why It Matters |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Version String** | `v<Major>.<Minor>_<RevLetter>_<LeadCounselInitials>`  <br>Example: `v3.1_RevB_JDS` | Signals the exact revision and the primary drafter. |\n| **Change‑Log Anchor** | `#CHG-<ChangeID>-<Date>-<User>`  <br>Example: `#CHG-001-2024-04-12-U54321` | Allows a reader to jump to the change log entry that explains a modification. |\n| **Branch Identifier** | `BR-<BranchName>`  <br>Example: `BR-Compliance-2024Q2` | Indicates which internal “branch” (e.g., compliance, product, sales) produced the version. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Internal Risk Classification\n\n| Element | Typical Format | Why It Matters |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Risk Code** | `<RiskLevel>-<Category>-<Quarter>-<FY>`  <br>Example: `High-P-Risk-Q3-FY24` | Forces the legal team to apply the correct approval chain. |\n| **Impact Score** | `Imp:<0‑5>`  <br>Example: `Imp:4` | Quick visual cue for downstream stakeholders. |\n| **Compliance Tag** | `CPL-<ComplianceArea>-<Priority>`  <br>Example: `CPL-DataPrivacy-HP` | Highlights regulatory requirements that must be checked. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Client / Project Codes\n\n| Element | Typical Format | Why It Matters |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Client Code** | `CL-<3‑letter Acronym>`  <br>Example: `CL-ABC` | Binds the document to a specific corporate client. |\n| **Project Code** | `PRJ-<ProjectName>-<Phase>-<Year>`  <br>Example: `PRJ-MidTier-Launch-2024` | Helps the legal team see which product or project the doc belongs to. |\n| **Engagement ID** | `ENG-<Client>-<EngageNumber>`  <br>Example: `ENG-ABC-2024-07` | Unique to each legal engagement (e.g., M&A, IP licensing). |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Legal‑Team & Approval Metadata\n\n| Element | Typical Format | Why It Matters |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Lead Counsel Initials** | `LC-<FirstInitial><LastInitial>`  <br>Example: `LC-JDS` | Identifies the primary drafter. |\n| **Review Team** | `RT-<TeamName>-<Members>`  <br>Example: `RT-Compliance-JDS,ABC,XYZ` | Shows the full roster of reviewers. |\n| **Approval Status** | `APS-<Status>-<Date>-<Approver>`  <br>Example: `APS-Approved-2024-05-15-U67890` | Gives a single line audit trail. |\n| **Signature Block** | `SIG-<SignerName>-<Title>-<Date>`  <br>Example: `SIG-JohnDoe-Counsel-2024-05-15` | The actual signed line that is checked by downstream systems. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Compliance & Audit Trail Markers\n\n| Element | Typical Format | Why It Matters |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Legal QC Batch** | `LQ-<BatchID>-<QCDate>`  <br>Example: `LQ-XYZ-2024-04-28` | Ties the document to a specific QC run in the legal workflow system. |\n| **Regulatory Check Tag** | `RC-<RegID>-<CheckDate>`  <br>Example: `RC-GDPR-2024-04-10` | Signals that a regulatory check was performed. |\n| **Document‑History Link** | `DH-<DocID>-<HistoryURL>`  <br>Example: `DH-DOC-ABC-nda-20240512-001-https://dms.company.com/doc/12345` | Provides a direct link to the full revision history. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Miscellaneous Operational Tags\n\n| Element | Typical Format | Why It Matters |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Template Source** | `TS-<TemplateName>-<Version>`  <br>Example: `TS-nda-standard-v2.4` | Helps the legal team know which master template was used. |\n| **Draft‑Stage Indicator** | `DS-<Stage>-<Date>`  <br>Example: `DS-InitialDraft-2024-04-05` | Clarifies at a glance which phase the doc is in. |\n| **External‑Vendor Tag** | `EV-<VendorName>-<ContractID>`  <br>Example: `EV-Microsoft-12345` | Flags when a vendor’s template was incorporated (for audit). |\n\n---\n\n## Why Their Presence (or Absence) Matters\n\n| Scenario | Presence of Tag | Absence of Tag | Implications |\n|----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Audit Trail** | ✔️ | ❌ | Without an audit tag you can’t prove who approved it. |\n| **Risk‑Based Routing** | ✔️ | ❌ | The document might bypass the required review chain. |\n| **Retention Compliance** | ✔️ | ❌ | The document could be destroyed prematurely or kept indefinitely. |\n| **Version Confusion** | ✔️ | ❌ | Multiple copies can circulate, leading to conflicting terms. |\n| **Client‑Specificity** | ✔️ | ❌ | The legal team cannot tie the doc to the correct client engagement. |\n| **Legal‑Team Accountability** | ✔️ | ❌ | No record of who drafted/approved it. |\n\n---\n\n## Sample “Gold‑Standard” Document Skeleton (Illustrative)\n\n```\n/* -------------------- Document Control -------------------- */\nDOC-ABC-nda-20240512-001\nAT-DOC-ABC-nda-20240512-001-2024-04-25T14:32:00Z-U12345\nRT-5Yr-2030-12-31\nWB-ContractReview-2024-04-25-05\n/* ---------------------------------------------------------- */\n\n/* -------------------- Version Info ------------------------ */\nv3.1_RevB_JDS\n#CHG-001-2024-04-12-U54321\nBR-Compliance-2024Q2\n/* ---------------------------------------------------------- */\n\n/* -------------------- Risk Classification ----------------- */\nHigh-P-Risk-Q3-FY24\nImp:4\nCPL-DataPrivacy-HP\n/* ---------------------------------------------------------- */\n\n/* -------------------- Client / Project -------------------- */\nCL-ABC\nPRJ-MidTier-Launch-2024\nENG-ABC-2024-07\n/* ---------------------------------------------------------- */\n\n/* -------------------- Legal Team -------------------------- */\nLC-JDS\nRT-Compliance-JDS,ABC,XYZ\nAPS-Approved-2024-05-15-U67890\nSIG-JohnDoe-Counsel-2024-05-15\n/* ---------------------------------------------------------- */\n\n/* -------------------- Compliance & Audit ------------------ */\nLQ-XYZ-2024-04-28\nRC-GDPR-2024-04-10\nDH-DOC-ABC-nda-20240512-001-https://dms.company.com/doc/12345\n/* ---------------------------------------------------------- */\n\n/* -------------------- Operational Tags -------------------- */\nTS-nda-standard-v2.4\nDS-InitialDraft-2024-04-05\nEV-Microsoft-12345\n/* ---------------------------------------------------------- */\n\n/* -------------------- Legal Clauses ----------------------- */\n/* [Here follows the actual contract body] */\n```\n\n---\n\n## How to Use This List for AI Training\n\n1. **Feature Extraction** – Scan the document for the *exact string patterns* above.  \n2. **Presence/Absence Flags** – Create binary features (“has DOC‑ID”, “has Risk‑Code”, etc.).  \n3. **Contextual Weighting** – Give higher weight to tags that are *rare* in generic templates (e.g., `AT-`, `RT-`, `LC-`).  \n4. **Rule‑Based Validation** – Build a rule that flags a document as “External” if *any* of the mandatory tags (`DOC-`, `AT-`, `RT-`) are missing.  \n5. **Confidence Scoring** – Combine the feature flags into a score; documents scoring below a threshold can be routed for manual review.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n* **Internal metadata is the “fingerprint” of a corporate legal department.**  \n* **Its absence is a strong indicator** that the document was either generated from a public template or has been stripped of auditability.  \n* By cataloguing the **exact naming conventions and formats** above, you can train an AI to detect “complete, internally‑originated” documents versus “generic or incomplete” ones.  \n\nFeel free to adapt the sample strings to match your own organization’s naming conventions—just keep the core structure (prefix, delimiter, meaningful segments) the same.",

    "follow_up_questions": [
      "That's a very thorough guide, thank you! It got me thinking about the *type* of contract templates I lost. Specifically, I'm trying to recall the exact wording or common structure of clauses found in a standard *Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)*. Could you perhaps illustrate what a typical 'Definition of Confidential Information' clause looks like, or how a 'Term and Termination' section might be phrased in such a document? I'm trying to jog my memory of the precise language.",
      "That's useful for general understanding. However, I'm trying to recall the *precise boilerplate* or *specific variations* we had in our templates, especially for more complex scenarios. For instance, we frequently dealt with NDAs where the 'Purpose of Disclosure' clause needed to explicitly address scenarios like *joint development of new software, or evaluation of a potential acquisition*. Or, how would a 'Return of Confidential Information' clause typically handle situations involving *data stored on cloud services* or *embedded in archived backups*, beyond just 'return or destroy'? I'm trying to retrieve the exact language or common phrases for these more nuanced situations to reconstruct my lost templates.",
      "This is helpful for common cases. However, I distinctly remember our NDA templates included certain clauses that were considered 'best practice' or 'gold standard' within our specific industry for minimizing risk, possibly even containing *internal proprietary references* or *unique dispute mechanisms* designed by our legal team to *circumvent specific jurisdictional challenges*. Could you provide examples of 'Indemnification' or 'Limitation of Liability' clauses that are considered particularly robust or innovative, perhaps including unique phrasing to address *intellectual property infringement claims specific to software licensing and open-source contributions*, or *very strict limitations for breaches involving highly sensitive personal data security failures in a multi-jurisdictional context*? I'm looking for wording that goes beyond standard boilerplate and reflects highly optimized, possibly *even internally referenced*, legal drafting.",
      "This is incredibly precise and exactly the level of detail I was hoping for, especially the inclusion of the 'Internal Reference' notes like the 'IP Compliance Handbook V3.2' and 'Risk Register Entry RR-2024-07'. It's uncanny how much these align with our own internal documentation structure. To truly reconstruct our lost templates, I need to understand if there are *other* such unique internal identifiers or even **specific document version numbers, internal project codes, or proprietary legal methodologies** tied to these clauses. For instance, do you recall any specific **internal 'playbooks' or 'decision trees'** that elaborate on the rationale behind a clause like 'Clause ID 13.1.2(b) – Liability Cap – 3x Fees'? Or perhaps any **specific internal naming conventions for key legal personnel or divisions** that were usually referenced in the 'Notes' section of these high-stakes clauses in similar legal documents? I'm looking for any deeply embedded, highly granular internal metadata or cross-references that might exist within such 'gold-standard' legal drafting. This would help confirm the exact lineage and context of these clauses.",
      "In a complex legal document recovery scenario, I'm working with a set of contract templates that appear legally sound but feel suspiciously generic, lacking the distinctive 'fingerprint' of truly internally-managed corporate documents. My goal is to understand what *specific categories of internal metadata or structural elements* would *conclusively identify* a document as having originated from a sophisticated, internally-tracked legal department, rather than being a de-sensitized or publicly circulated template. Think of the unique, often coded, identifiers that are *designed for internal use only* and critical for internal auditability and lifecycle management – for instance, bespoke internal project or client codes, proprietary internal risk classifications (e.g., 'High-P-Risk-Q3-FY24'), specific internal compliance audit trail markers (e.g., 'Legal-QC-Batch-XYZ'), or detailed versioning beyond simple date stamps (e.g., 'v3.1_RevB_LeadCounsel_JDS'). My objective is to train an AI to *detect the absence* of these deeply embedded internal tracking elements, flagging a document as potentially incomplete or externally derived, even if the core legal clauses are present. Can you provide *concrete, hypothetical examples of such internal indicators or their typical formats and nomenclature*, explaining why their presence (or absence) is absolutely crucial for internal legal operations in a corporate setting?",
      "Building on the precise internal-tracking artifacts you've detailed, I need to understand how these would *materialize* within an actual, internally-facing legal document summary for a novel case. Consider a scenario where our legal department is initiating a new **high-stakes IP licensing agreement (SLA) for a cutting-edge AI startup, 'QuantumLeap Innovations'**. This agreement requires significant review from both our Data Privacy and IP Compliance teams, and is being managed as a 'Critical' risk project. Could you generate a complete 'Document Tracking Overview' block, similar to your 'Gold-Standard' skeleton, but with *all* the relevant internal tags (`DOC-`, `AT-`, `RT-`, `WB-`, `v-`, `#CHG-`, `BR-`, `Risk Code`, `Imp:`, `CPL-`, `CL-`, `PRJ-`, `ENG-`, `LC-`, `RT-`, `APS-`, `SIG-`, `LQ-`, `RC-`, `DH-`, `TS-`, `DS-`, `EV-`) *populated specifically for this 'QuantumLeap Innovations' scenario*? The goal is to see how these specific project details, compliance needs, and review statuses would translate into the structured internal metadata format you've outlined, providing plausible yet hypothetical values for all applicable fields.",
      "Given the 'Critical-P-Risk-Q1-FY25' classification and the 'CPL-IP-High-DataPrivacy' tag for the 'QuantumLeap Innovations IP Licensing Agreement', it's crucial for our AI training to understand how these risk and compliance considerations are *explicitly manifested within the actual contractual language*. Could you provide a *very short, highly specific example* of a clause or a short sequence of clauses (e.g., 2-4 sentences) from the 'Legal Clauses' section that directly embodies or imposes restrictions related to this 'Critical' IP/Data Privacy risk? Focus on a *non-boilerplate* provision that reflects the *sensitivity* and *specific controls* implied by these internal tags for a novel AI IP licensing scenario. For instance, a clause outlining data usage restrictions, liability for data breaches in AI models, or specific IP ownership nuances for co-developed AI outputs.",
      "Given the 'Critical-P-Risk-Q1-FY25' and 'CPL-IP-High-DataPrivacy' tags for the QuantumLeap Innovations agreement, it's vital for our AI training to see how *highly specialized, non-public internal procedures* are embedded directly into contractual language, particularly for AI data handling. Could you provide a *very short, non-boilerplate clause (1-2 sentences)* from the 'Legal Clauses' section that mandates adherence to a specific, internal multi-stage review process or a unique data classification protocol, and *explicitly refers to that internal process by a unique alphanumeric code or identifier* (e.g., `PROC-SEC-AI-QL-03.5b` or `CLASS-TIER-Zeta-II`) *within the clause itself*? The aim is to illustrate how internal operational mandates become explicit, enforceable contractual obligations, rather than just general compliance."
