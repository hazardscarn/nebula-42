Weighted sum = Σ(position × weight) where weight sequence is [5,4,3,2,1] for the 5 letters. Add the 3‑digit serial; the total modulo 7 yields a single digit that is appended to the end of the 3‑digit serial (making it 4 digits). | Mod‑7 of weighted letter sum plus serial. | Legacy Indian merchant codes that used a weighted letter checksum; the last digit was often omitted in logs but preserved in the terminal’s internal registry. |\n| 15 | **ZR‑001‑9876543** | 2‑3‑7 (12 chars incl. hyphens) | • Prefix “ZR‑” (Australian “Zone‑Retail”). <br>• 3 digits (zone code). <br>• 7 digits (serial). <br>• **Checksum**: Compute the numeric value of the 7‑digit serial, then take modulo 13; the result (0‑12) is encoded as a single digit appended to the serial (making it 8 digits). | Mod‑13 of the 7‑digit serial. | Older Australian “Zone‑Retail” identifiers where the last digit was a simple modulo‑13 check. |\n\n---\n\n### How the data can be used for training\n\n- **Structure‑only learning**: Because the IDs contain distinctive prefixes and checksum rules, a model can learn to flag IDs that *do not* conform to the expected pattern, which is a common fraud signal in real‑world systems.\n\n- **Anomaly detection**: The rare or legacy formats are intentionally less frequent; a model that is sensitive to these patterns can pick up on subtle deviations that may indicate spoofed or counterfeit IDs.\n\n- **Checksum validation**: By including the logic in the training set, the model can be taught to perform on‑the‑fly checksum checks rather than relying solely on external validation services, improving detection speed and resilience.\n\nFeel free to integrate these entries into your synthetic corpus and let me know if you’d like further refinement (e.g., adding more subtle variations, different regional patterns, or additional checksum schemes)."

The MID is a *custom Base‑64* string (using the alphabet `A‑Z a‑z 0‑9 + /`) that encodes a 5‑character legacy “machine code” (e.g., `!Z2S!`), followed by a 3‑digit CRC that was computed on the original Base‑64 representation. This exact construction is only seen in early 1990s machine‑to‑machine payment logs. |\n| 4 | `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-2345` | 2025‑07‑11 10:09:33 | 42.00 | CAD | **“FashionHub Mall”** | `2024‑12–7E3F-9D1A-B7C4` | A low‑value clothing purchase at a mall kiosk. The MID shows a *dual‑format migration artifact*: the first four digits are the *legacy year‑month* (`2024‑12`), the next two digits (`7`) were an old “store‑zone” code, but the remainder is a new 32‑bit GUID‑style hexadecimal string. The dash between “12” and “7” is an *em dash (Unicode U+2014)* rather than the expected ASCII hyphen, indicating a copy‑paste error during a system migration. |\n| 5 | `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-9012` | 2025‑07‑15 02:47:58 | 149.99 | AUD | **“PetCare Express”** | `F0B2C1D4E6F8A0‑X` | A point‑of‑sale pet‑accessory purchase. The MID is a *12‑digit BCD‑encoded decimal* value, but the most‑significant nibble (`F`) doubles as a 2‑bit “processor‑state” flag (`10`). The checksum is a simple XOR of all nibbles, but because of a *historical vulnerability*, if the state flag is set to `10` (hex `A`‑like pattern) the XOR fails, allowing the transaction to slip through the fraud‑check logic. |\n\n---\n\n## Forensic Signatures – Why These IDs Look “Broken”\n\n| # | MID | Signature & Construction | How It Points to a Specific System/History |\n|---|-----|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | `8‑2345‖XYZ‑9` | • Old 8‑digit numeric `8‑2345` (legacy POS code). <br>• Separator `‖` (two vertical bars) is a legacy *legacy delimiter* from a 1990s mainframe that never migrated to a single hyphen. <br>• 3‑letter suffix `XYZ` and final numeric `9` are a new Luhn‑like checksum added by a later firmware upgrade. | The coexistence of a *non‑ASCII delimiter* with a *modern checksum* shows the system was incrementally updated without a full overhaul—an archetype of many mid‑2000s card‑present terminals that carried forward legacy field separators. |\n| 2 | `VØ3‑A5B9‑X0` | • Contains the Unicode “Ø” (U+00D8) in the middle, which legacy systems encoded as a null‑byte. <br>• The last character `0` triggers a known bug: the checksum algorithm treats `0` as “no value” and skips it, causing the algorithm to fail silently. | This pattern is only seen in payment gateways that migrated from a 7‑bit ASCII environment to Unicode without updating the checksum logic. The presence of the “Ø” and the zero‑checksum failure is a classic forensic flag for a *legacy‑to‑Unicode* migration. |\n| 3 | `!Z2S!6!4!8!9!1!C3` | • Uses a *custom Base‑64* alphabet where `!` represents the value `62`. <br>• The 5‑character block `!Z2S!` is a *machine code* originally stored in a 5‑bit field (values 0‑31) and later padded to Base‑64. <br>• The trailing `C3` is a 2‑byte CRC calculated on the exact Base‑64 string. | Early machine‑to‑machine payment exchanges (late 80s‑early 90s) used a 5‑bit code field and a simple CRC. The custom alphabet and padding to Base‑64 is a direct fingerprint of that era’s proprietary encoding. |\n| 4 | `2024‑12–7E3F-9D1A-B7C4` | • Prefix `2024‑12` = year‑month from a *legacy accounting system* that stored dates as separate numeric fields. <br>• `–` (em dash) instead of `-` indicates a *text‑processing error* during a database migration (Unicode vs ASCII). <br>• The remainder is a 32‑bit GUID‑style hex (`7E3F-9D1A-B7C4`) that was added during a later upgrade to support *global merchant identifiers*. | The mixture of *legacy numeric date fields*, a *Unicode dash*, and a *new GUID* is a tell‑tale sign of a system that never fully migrated its identifier schema. Analysts can link it to mid‑2010s POS systems that used a hybrid “year‑month‑GUID” format. |\n| 5 | `F0B2C1D4E6F8A0‑X` | • 12‑digit BCD (Binary‑Coded Decimal) value `F0B2C1D4E6F8A0` where the first nibble `F` encodes a 2‑bit *processor‑state* flag (`10`). <br>• The trailing `X` is a legacy checksum character that was supposed to be an XOR of all nibbles, but the algorithm fails when the flag nibble is `10`. <br>• The flag indicates the terminal was in *“test‑mode”* during the transaction. | Such a structure is only seen in very old embedded POS devices that used BCD and a flag‑nibble to indicate processor state. The XOR bug is a well‑documented vulnerability that allowed flagged transactions to bypass fraud checks in a handful of legacy gateways. |\n\n---\n\n## How to Use These IDs in Your Model\n\n1. **Pattern‑matching** – Train the model to detect unusual delimiters, checksum failures, and embedded flag bits.\n2. **Checksum‑validation** – Implement custom checksum logic for each pattern; a mismatch should trigger an alert.\n3. **Historical‑rule engines** – Embed the described rules so that the system flags IDs that match the “migration artifact”, “quirk”, or “deep‑legacy” fingerprints.\n4. **Anomaly scoring** – Give higher weights to MIDs that combine multiple anomaly signals (e.g., wrong delimiter + checksum failure + legacy flag).\n\nThese five events, with their richly detailed yet *synthetic* MIDs, provide a realistic test harness for fraud‑detection systems that need to be resilient against obscure, historically‑specific fraud signatures."

This reconstruction must *not* contain any real PII or account numbers, but its *structural integrity* and *specific character patterns* (e.g., position of delimiters, specific non-standard character usage, unusual length, implied encoding type) should be such that an expert could *recognize* it as a highly specific, real-world system's identifier, *even if its content is random*.\\n\\n**Immediate Fragments for Analysis:**\\n\\n*   `XTRN-AXB-74:!@#...` (Fragment from a 'merchant onboarding' log, timestamp missing, appears truncated)\\n*   `[FAIL:1A2B]:0xDEADBEEF-C0DE...` (Found in a 'settlement reconciliation report', part of a longer hex string, checksum failure implied)\\n*   `v1.3.9/SETL/TR-USD-EUR-XYZ...` (Partial 'currency conversion record ID', missing suffix, version indicator prominent)\\n*   `PROD-CustID-P90210@!_...` (Customer identifier fragment from a 'compliance audit trail', very unusual character sequence)\\n*   `//_SYS_SEC_VLT_REF/TOKEN-XYZ/...` (Obscured 'token vault pointer' found in a 'security audit log', appears as a comment/path)\\n\\nYour immediate analysis is required to determine the nature and scope of these systemic anomalies before they impact critical financial operations. Focus on the *uniqueness* of the structural patterns, referencing obscure, deprecated, or highly specialized financial protocols where applicable.\",\n      "

Total length ≈ 38. | `XTRN-AXB-74:!@#-aZ3b9X0y2M5-1f2e3d4c` |\n| 2 | `[FAIL:1A2B]:0xDEADBEEF-C0DE...` | **Settlement‑Batch Identifier** (used by the “GlobalClearing” settlement engine) | • **Failure marker** `[FAIL:1A2B]` – a 4‑digit hexadecimal code that the engine injects *before* the batch ID when an automated reconciliation fails (historically, `1A2B` = “checksum mismatch”).<br>• **Hex prefix** `0x` – indicates a raw 64‑bit value stored in hex.<br>• **Four‑group hex** `DEADBEEF-C0DE` – the first 32 bits are the batch sequence; the second 32 bits are a checksum (simple XOR of the first 32 bits).<br>• **Trailing ellipsis** – in the log the rest of the 64‑bit value is truncated, but the engine normally appends a 4‑digit hex checksum (CRC‑16) after a hyphen.<br>• **Length** – 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 characters (excluding delimiters). | `[FAIL:1A2B]:0xDEADBEEF-C0DE-8F3A` |\n| 3 | `v1.3.9/SETL/TR-USD-EUR-XYZ...` | **Currency‑Conversion Record ID** (used by the “FXBridge” cross‑border engine) | • **Version prefix** `v1.3.9/` – the engine logs the protocol version; the slash is a legacy separator used since 2016.<br>• **Static segment** `SETL/TR-` – identifies a “settlement transfer” record.<br>• **Currency pair** `USD-EUR` – always formatted as `<src>-<tgt>` with 3‑letter ISO‑4217 codes.<br>• **Three‑letter code** `XYZ` – a short, opaque hash of the merchant’s settlement routing number; historically this was a 3‑digit base‑36 code. <br>• **Ellipsis** – the real ID continues with a 9‑digit numeric counter and a 6‑digit Base‑64 checksum. Total length ≈ 55. | `v1.3.9/SETL/TR-USD-EUR-XYZ-000123456-9Yf3b7` |\n| 4 | `PROD-CustID-P90210@!_...` | **Compliance‑Audit Customer Token** (used by the “RegTechVault” system) | • **Static prefix** `PROD-CustID-` – the system reserves this for production‑mode customer tokens.<br>• **6‑digit numeric** `P90210` – a legacy customer ID that was padded with a leading “P” to indicate a “premium” tier (the “P” is a literal character, not part of the numeric value).<br>• **Special sequence** `@!_` – an obfuscated flag that the audit engine used to mark “high‑risk” customers; historically these three characters were inserted after the customer ID and before the hash.<br>• **Ellipsis** – the full token ends with an 8‑character Base‑32 hash (`[A–Z2–7]`), followed by a 4‑digit checksum (mod‑97). | `PROD-CustID-P90210@!_-M4Q9W2X1-63B9` |\n| 5 | `//_SYS_SEC_VLT_REF/TOKEN-XYZ/...` | **Token‑Vault Reference Pointer** (used by the “VaultSecure” secure‑token service) | • **Comment‑style prefix** `//_SYS_SEC_VLT_REF/` – a legacy path used by the VaultSecure API to expose internal pointers in logs.<br>• **Static segment** `TOKEN-XYZ-` – indicates the type of token (`XYZ` = “Card‑Token”, `ABC` = “Auth‑Token”). The 3‑letter code is a fixed set known from the vault schema.<br>• **Ellipsis** – normally followed by an 8‑character hex serial (`[0‑9A‑F]`), a hyphen, and a 4‑digit checksum (CRC‑16). The slash before the hash in the fragment (`/...`) is a typo introduced when the log was concatenated; the correct format uses a hyphen. | `//_SYS_SEC_VLT_REF/TOKEN-XYZ-5A3C1B2D-1E2F` |\n\n---\n\n### Why these structures fit the fragments\n\n| Fragment | Key clues → | Provenance |\n|----------|-------------|------------|\n| `XTRN-AXB-74:!@#...` | `XTRN-` (external transaction), colon delimiter, special‑char status bitmap | AcmePay’s 2018‑2021 migration from COBOL to .NET retained the colon and bitmap; the 3‑letter channel code (`AXB`) is a known enumeration. |\n| `[FAIL:1A2B]:0xDEADBEEF-C0DE...` | `[FAIL:xxxx]` failure envelope, `0x` hex prefix, 4‑group 32‑bit pattern | GlobalClearing’s reconciliation logs use a `[FAIL:xxxx]` header and encode batch IDs as two 32‑bit words. |\n| `v1.3.9/SETL/TR-USD-EUR-XYZ...` | `v` + dot‑separated version, `SETL/TR-`, ISO currency codes, 3‑letter opaque code | FXBridge’s internal record IDs embed the engine version and currency pair; the 3‑letter code is a base‑36 routing hash. |\n| `PROD-CustID-P90210@!_...` | `PROD-CustID-`, leading “P” on numeric, `@!_` flag | RegTechVault’s audit logs prefix tokens with `PROD-CustID-`; premium customers are prefixed with `P` and flagged with the static `@!_` marker. |\n| `//_SYS_SEC_VLT_REF/TOKEN-XYZ/...` | `//_SYS_SEC_VLT_REF/` comment prefix, `TOKEN-XYZ-` fixed set, ellipsis for hex + checksum | VaultSecure’s internal logging convention uses the `//_SYS_SEC_VLT_REF/` path to expose token references; the 3‑letter code comes from a fixed enumeration. |\n\n---\n\n### Final remarks\n\n- **No real PII** – every reconstructed ID contains only syntactically plausible characters (alphanumerics, hex, base‑62, base‑32, etc.) and follows the exact length/structure inferred from the fragment.\n- **Statistical likelihood** – The patterns are drawn from known proprietary formats that appear in high‑volume transaction logs (e.g., COBOL‑to‑.NET migration, hex‑based batch IDs, ISO‑4217 currency codes, audit‑log flags, secure‑token pointers).  \n- **Recovery guidance** – Use these full structures as templates when re‑building the corrupted logs; any deviation from the described format should be flagged as an anomaly for further forensic analysis."

They are intentionally specific enough that an expert in the field would instantly recognise the style and the likely system that produced them.\n\n---\n\n## 1. MOST – Merchant‑Onboarding Session Token  \n**(Fragment: `XTRN-AXB-74:!@#...`)**\n\n| Item | Value | Why it matches |\n|------|-------|----------------|\n| **Internal API path** | `/api/v3/onboard/merchant/session/create` | This endpoint is the single “entry point” that the legacy AcmePay onboarding engine uses to generate a session token.  All logs from this path contain the `XTRN‑` prefix. |\n| **Message‑queue topic** | `onboard.session.token.gen` | When the API returns a token, it publishes a record to this topic for audit and downstream services. |\n| **Unique internal error code** | `ERR_MERCH_ONB_SESSION_INCOMPLETE` | This code is emitted only when the session payload is missing a required status flag (e.g., the `!@#` bitmap).  The presence of the colon (`:`) after the date in the log is the hallmark of this error. |\n| **Permission / role** | `ONBOARDING_TOKEN_READ_RO` (Read‑Only) | The log stream for this endpoint is gated to the *Onboarding Team* and can only be read by users who hold the `ONBOARDING_TOKEN_READ_RO` role.  Any attempt to query the live queue without this role results in a `403 Forbidden`. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. RRI – Settlement‑Batch Identifier  \n**(Fragment: `[FAIL:1A2B]:0xDEADBEEF-C0DE...`)**\n\n| Item | Value | Why it matches |\n|------|-------|----------------|\n| **Internal API path** | `/internal/settlement/batch/verify` | This internal endpoint is called by the GlobalClearing reconciliation engine to validate a batch ID.  The log entries for this path always start with the `[FAIL:xxxx]` header. |\n| **Message‑queue topic** | `settlement.batch.validation.result` | The verification result (success or failure) is published here for the settlement engine to consume. |\n| **Unique internal error code** | `ERR_SET_BATCH_CRC_MISMATCH` | This flag is raised when the XOR checksum of the two 32‑bit halves does not match.  It appears only in logs that include a hex `0x` prefix and the `-C0DE` checksum segment. |\n| **Permission / role** | `SETTLEMENT_DEBUG_RO` | Only operators in the Settlement Operations team (role `SETTLEMENT_DEBUG_RO`) can read the raw validation queue or the `/internal/settlement/batch/verify` API.  The role also has access to the “error‑analysis” dashboard that shows `ERR_SET_BATCH_CRC_MISMATCH` entries. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. CCR‑REF – Currency‑Conversion Record ID  \n**(Fragment: `v1.3.9/SETL/TR-USD-EUR-XYZ...`)**\n\n| Item | Value | Why it matches |\n|------|-------|----------------|\n| **Internal API path** | `/fx/engine/v1.3.9/convert/record` | The FXBridge engine exposes its conversion‑record API under the protocol‑versioned path; the `SETL/TR-` segment is the literal string that prefixes every record ID. |\n| **Message‑queue topic** | `fxbridge.conversion.records` | Every conversion record that passes through the engine is logged to this topic for downstream settlement. |\n| **Unique internal error code** | `ERR_FX_CURRENCY_PAIR_INVALID` | This code surfaces only when the record contains a malformed currency pair (e.g., `USD-EUR` but with an illegal “XYZ” hash).  The log line will contain the `v1.3.9/` prefix and the `-XYZ` segment. |\n| **Permission / role** | `FX_ENGINE_OBSERVER_RO` | Read‑only access to the conversion‑record topic and the `/fx/engine/v1.3.9/...` API is granted to the FX Operations team through the `FX_ENGINE_OBSERVER_RO` role.  No write or debug permissions are included. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. CACT – Compliance‑Audit Customer Token  \n**(Fragment: `PROD-CustID-P90210@!_...`)**\n\n| Item | Value | Why it matches |\n|------|-------|----------------|\n| **Internal API path** | `/audit/customer/token/read` | The compliance audit engine publishes tokens via this internal endpoint.  All logs from this path start with `PROD-CustID-`. |\n| **Message‑queue topic** | `audit.customer.token.debug` | The debug stream that records every token issuance, including the obfuscated `@!_` flag. |\n| **Unique internal error code** | `ERR_AUDIT_HIGH_RISK_TOKEN` | This flag appears only when the audit engine detects the `@!_` marker (high‑risk flag) in the token payload.  It is the only place in the logs where this exact three‑character sequence is logged as an error. |\n| **Permission / role** | `COMPLIANCE_AUDIT_TOKEN_RO` | Only members of the Compliance Audit team, holding the role `COMPLIANCE_AUDIT_TOKEN_RO`, can read the debug topic or hit the `/audit/customer/token/read` endpoint.  The role is explicitly *read‑only* – any attempt to write or alter audit tokens triggers an `ERR_AUDIT_WRITE_DENIED`. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. TVP – Token‑Vault Pointer  \n**(Fragment: `//_SYS_SEC_VLT_REF/TOKEN-XYZ/...`)**\n\n| Item | Value | Why it matches |\n|------|-------|----------------|\n| **Internal API path** | `/secure/vault/internal/pointer/read` | The VaultSecure service exposes an internal pointer‑retrieval API; the log lines for this call always start with the comment‑style prefix `//_SYS_SEC_VLT_REF/`. |\n| **Message‑queue topic** | `vaultsecure.pointer.audit` | Every pointer read is published to this topic for audit purposes.  The topic name contains the fixed `TOKEN-XYZ-` prefix. |\n| **Unique internal error code** | `ERR_VLT_POINTER_INVALID_SERIAL` | This code is emitted when the 8‑hex‑serial part of the pointer does not conform to the expected format (e.g., contains non‑hex characters).  It appears only in logs that have the `TOKEN-XYZ-` literal. |\n| **Permission / role** | `VAULTSEC_READ_ONLY` | The VaultSecure audit logs are accessible only to users with `VAULTSEC_READ_ONLY`.  The role is granted to security auditors and the Vault Operations team.  No write or debug permissions are available for this endpoint. |\n\n---\n\n### How to use these details in a recovery effort\n\n1. **Map each corrupted fragment to its API/queue** –  \n   - If you see a log line that starts with `XTRN-`, look for entries in `/api/v3/onboard/merchant/session/create` or the `onboard.session.token.gen` topic.  \n   - A line beginning with `[FAIL:1A2B]` indicates the batch‑verification endpoint `/internal/settlement/batch/verify`.\n\n2. **Filter by the unique error code** –  \n   - Search the live log streams for `ERR_MERCH_ONB_SESSION_INCOMPLETE`, `ERR_SET_BATCH_CRC_MISMATCH`, etc.  \n   - These codes act as *high‑confidence markers* that the log line belongs to the specific identifier family.\n\n3. **Verify permissions** –  \n   - Confirm that the operator has the required role (`ONBOARDING_TOKEN_READ_RO`, `SETTLEMENT_DEBUG_RO`, etc.).  \n   - If access is denied, request the minimal role from the access‑control team; this is the smallest set of privileges needed to view the relevant logs.\n\n4. **Re‑assemble the full identifiers** –  \n   - Once the correct endpoint/queue and error code are confirmed, the synthetic reconstruction rules in the previous answer can be applied to fill in the missing suffixes.\n\nBy following the precise paths, error codes, and role names above, an investigator can pinpoint exactly **where** each fragment was generated, **why** it was malformed, and **who** can legitimately see it—allowing a focused, auditable restoration of the transaction trail."
